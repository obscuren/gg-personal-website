# Jeff's Personal Website

Hi, my name is Jeff and I've co-founded [Grid Games](http://grid-games.com) together with my brother [Joe](http://joe.grid-games.com). I'm a programmer and I love to create games. My previous project was [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org), which I co founded as well.

I go by [@jeffehh](http://twitter.com/jeffehh) on Twitter and you can contact me through electronic mail at jeff @ grid-games.com. I troll reddit as [jeffehh](http://reddit.com/u/jeffehhh). My LinkedIn is dead and I don't do Facebook since 2011.
